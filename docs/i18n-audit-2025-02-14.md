# Internationalisation & Performance Audit — 2025-02-14

## Summary of Findings
- **Localized routes failed on direct load** because Netlify was not rewriting `/pt/*` and `/es/*` requests back to the SPA entry point. Adding a SPA fallback ensures the React router receives every locale-prefixed path.
- **Footer navigation links were duplicated** across three nearly identical blocks, increasing bundle size and risking inconsistent updates across locales. Centralising the configuration keeps the UI consistent while making translation bindings easier to maintain.

## Fixes Applied
1. Added a Netlify `_redirects` rule so every non-asset request falls back to `index.html`, restoring `/pt` and `/es` hydration when loaded directly or shared externally.【F:public/_redirects†L1-L1】
2. Refactored the footer navigation into a data-driven map that reuses a single rendering path for all column links, eliminating repeated markup while preserving Stackbit editing attributes.【F:components/Footer.tsx†L1-L114】

## Recommended Follow-up Steps
- **Verify deployment rewrites**: After the next deploy, open `/pt`, `/pt/shop`, `/es`, and `/es/shop` directly in a private window to confirm Netlify serves the SPA shell instead of a 404.
- **Monitor bundle size**: Track the `dist/assets/index-*.js` chunk size after future feature work. If it grows significantly, consider splitting rarely-visited routes (e.g., Academy, Training) into more granular lazy modules.
- **Audit remaining duplicated schemas**: The Decap configuration still repeats entire page schemas per locale. Enabling collection-level i18n or shared field groups would reduce editor bloat and lower the chance of mismatch (see `docs/decap-cms-audit.md`).
- **Translation coverage checks**: Add CI linting to detect missing `pt`/`es` keys in `content/translations/*.json` so localisation gaps do not regress page rendering.
