# Kapunka Upload Mirror

Binary assets are intentionally excluded from this mirror to keep pull requests lightweight.

- Canonical files remain in content/uploads/ and are served in production.
- Editors can replace these placeholders by restoring the real assets once the Visual Editor accepts binaries again.
- Leave this README (and the empty .gitkeep) in place so the folder stays tracked.
