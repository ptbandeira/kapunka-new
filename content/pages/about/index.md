  Kapunka began as a social project inside the women's cooperatives of the Souss Valley. Monica learned to grade kernels by hand, press oil without solvents, and barter with pharmacists who respected the discipline of slow beauty. Those rituals shaped our first facial oils shared with friends recovering from laser resurfacing.

  Twelve years later we still return to the same cooperatives, now investing in cold-press machinery and scholarships for the daughters of the matriarchs who trained us. Every protocol we release is vetted with dermatologists to ensure the craft remains useful inside clinics—not just romantic in storytelling.
