    title: Where Kapunka comes from
    body: >-
      Kapunka began with a simple idea: the way we touch changes how we heal.
      Years beside clinicians shaped a method that is careful, precise, and
      kind.

    title: The name
    body: >-
      ‘Kapunka’ was first heard by our founder in a school in Ubud. The
      word—thank you—became a promise: make care that gives back. Be thankful to
      your skin.
