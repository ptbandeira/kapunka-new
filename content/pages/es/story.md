metaDescription: >-
  Discover the Kapunka manifesto: regenerative sourcing, clinically tested rituals,
  and a commitment to transparent, minimalist skincare that honours the cooperatives
  who craft our argan oil.
heroTitle: The Kapunka Manifesto
heroSubtitle: Ritual skincare that protects the barrier while honouring the women and landscapes that make it possible.
manifestoIntro: >-
  Kapunka exists to care for skin with the same reverence we show the soil, seeds,
  and hands that sustain it. Every choice we make is guided by reciprocity: we give
  back to the cooperatives that teach us, the clinics that trust us, and the people
  who invite Kapunka into their daily ritual.
manifestoStatements:
  - heading: Rooted in cooperative wisdom
    highlight: We reinvest in the women-led argan cooperatives that taught us every ritual.
    body: |-
      From the Souss Valley to our studio, Kapunka is powered by intergenerational
      expertise. We partner exclusively with women-run cooperatives, guaranteeing
      dignified pay, long-term contracts, and reinvestment into local education and
      biodiversity programmes.
  - heading: Science with soul
    highlight: Clinical rigor meets sensorial care.
    body: |-
      Each formula is iterated alongside dermatologists and estheticians who see the
      impact on real skin every day. We pair their data with sensorial textures and
      scents that invite slow, mindful rituals rather than rushed routines.
  - heading: Less, better, transparent
    highlight: Minimal routines, fully traceable ingredients.
    body: |-
      We publish every ingredient list, percentage, and supplier relationship. Our
      catalogue favours multi-use heroes over endless launches, so clinicians and
      at-home ritualists can trust every drop to work harder with less.

          Kapunka emerges from our founders' return to the argan cooperatives of
          Tazghlilt.

          We begin bottling the first cold-pressed batches by working directly with
          women artisans who teach us their extraction rituals.
